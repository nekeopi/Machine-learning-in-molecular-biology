These are solutions to assignments I completed during the Machine Learning for Molecular Biology course throughout the semester.

The main goal was to analyze a dataset of genetic sequences and determine which of them are exons (protein-coding regions) and which are introns (non-coding regions).

By applying various machine learning algorithms – and in some cases deep learning methods such as DNNs and CNNs – I was able to make accurate predictions and successfully classify/group the sequences with high probability.
